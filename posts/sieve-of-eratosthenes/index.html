        <p>I had a bad experience with the Sieve of Eratosthenes during a college test, I became traumatized by it and tried to avoid it. During this holiday break I decided to face my fears (lol) and successfully implemented it ruby (not very idiomatic but ruby still)</p>

<p>My favorite parts of this algorithm were:</p>

<ul>
<li>The fact that I don&rsquo;t have to iterate the whole sieve! I can do it just for _sqrt(n) _since the factors of any number are always composed by two numbers and one of them is always lower than the <em>sqrt</em> of any given number n.</li>

<li><p>The usage of ruby&rsquo;s inline _if _statements</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">def populate_array(n)
  arr = Array.new(n, true)
  arr[0] = false
  arr[1] = false
  arr
end

def print_array(a)
  count = 0
  while count &lt; a.length
    puts &quot;#{count} is prime&quot; if a[count]
    count += 1
  end
end

def mark_factors(a, count)
  mult = 2
  while count * mult &lt;= a.length
    a[count * mult] = false
    mult += 1
  end
  a
end

def sieve(a)
  count = 2
  while count &lt;= Math.sqrt(a.length)
    a = mark_factors(a, count) if a[count]
    count += 1
  end
end

def main
  puts 'Give me the limit for your primes'
  n = Integer(gets.chomp)
  a = populate_array(n + 1)
  sieve(a)
  print_array(a)
end

main
</code></pre></li>
