      <description>I started my batch at Recurse Center two weeks ago. One of my goals for the batch is to become proficient in go. To get started I went through &amp;ldquo;A tour of Go&amp;rdquo;, after that I decided to work on my first Go project.
The project was a Client / Server conversation, a limited conversation. As a client you are able to connect to an IP:PORT server and send three commands to the server: {1: ls, 2: who, 3: pwd}.</description>
